* Russel Gregor collaboration (just started)

* Document: https://github.com/cyberaide/NIST-analytics/raw/main/NIST-analytics.pdf
* Task List will be managed at:

   I like to propose to manage tasks at https://github.com/orgs/cyberaide/projects/1

   You can add tasks ...

* Slack:

  I need something other then e-mail to coordinate with Russel and others I propose to use slack.
  There we will do coordinating posts for the document, not long discussions about content.
  Its used to stay in sync so you get notifications when a new version of the document, section,
  and so on is posted: https://nist-analytics.slack.com

* Experimenting with catalog

  entries: students: https://github.com/laszewsk/nist/tree/main/catalog

  example deployment:

  * gregor: https://github.com/laszewsk/ai-services

  * gregor: https://laszewsk.github.io/ai-services/

I propose people to commit to tasks for the document

* obvious tasks are sections  that have no content, adding use cases, security section, data section

* We used to have more content, but i removed it so that it is easier to decide where others want to contribute to. We can add that once needed

* Gregor: focus on catalog
