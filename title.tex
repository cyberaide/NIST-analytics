%	Author Order and Grouping. Always identify the primary author/creator first (s/he does not have to be a NIST author). For publications with multiple authors, group authors by their organizational affiliation. The organizational groupings and the names within each grouping should generally be ordered by decreasing level of contribution.
%	For non-NIST authors, list their city and state below their organization name.
%	For NIST authors, include the Division and Laboratory names (but do not include their city and state).

Certain commercial entities, equipment, or materials may be identified in this document to describe an experimental procedure or concept adequately. Such identification is not intended to imply recommendation or endorsement by NIST, nor is it intended to imply that the entities, materials, or equipment are necessarily the best available for the purpose. 

There may be references in this publication to other publications currently under development by NIST in accordance with its assigned statutory responsibilities. The information in this publication, including concepts and methodologies, may be used by federal agencies even before the completion of such companion publications. Thus, until each publication is completed, current requirements, guidelines, and procedures, where they exist, remain operative. For planning and transition purposes, federal agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new publications by NIST. 

Organizations are encouraged to review all publications during public comment periods and provide feedback to NIST. All NIST publications are available at http://www.nist.gov/publication-portal.cfm.
