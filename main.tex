December 2021   & RcR 	& \TODO{russel}{Gregor: On the organization of the outline sections and sub sections: 7.2 In my domain, the concept behind the term 'Landscape' would not be related to Specification. I am interested to work on this sub section so I amm looking forward to some clarification on how you see Landscape as a sub of Specification. Depending on the 'vision' of the topics / content for 7.2 and Appendix B, (which I am also interested to work on) they may have some overlap.} \\
