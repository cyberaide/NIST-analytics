\section*{Abstract}

\normalsize This document summarizes the NIST Analytics Service Framework that targets to analytics functionalities to be hosted on computational resources including Clouds, Containers, and High Performance Computing (HPC). Although we use the RE presentational State Transfer (REST) to formulate some details of the architecture, it is independent from REST and can be formulated in other frameworks. While using REST we use a familiar pattern for architect, implementers, and strategists. Due to the many frameworks, programming languages and services supporting REST the architecture can easily be enhanced and implemented with various technical solutions. 
The analytics framework also targets big data. Big data is a term used to describe extensive datasets, primarily in the characteristics of volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. While opportunities exist with Big Data analytics, the data characteristics can overwhelm traditional technical approaches, and the growth of data is outpacing scientific and technological advances in data analytics. To advance progress in Big Data analytics, the NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) is working to develop consensus on important fundamental concepts related to Big Data. The results are reported in the NIST Big Data Interoperability Framework (NBDIF) series of volumes.\\

\section{Use Cases for Analytics Services}


\subsection{Use Case Development Process}

To specify use cases for our analytics framework, we encourage contributors to contact us and provide us with their high-level descriptions of their use cases. The use cases should be focusing on highlighting one or multiple aspects of the features related to analytics frameworks. While inspecting the various features we intend to collect and analyze them in various contexts that are relevant for analytics users. The lessons learned from this analysis are to be integrated into this document in order to formulate a comprehensive vendor neutral analytics framework.
Use cases can be formulated in various format but should include diagrams that make them easy to comprehend as well as allowing the reader to extract the specific analytical aspects. Such diagrams can include functional cross diagrams, process diagrams and others.
Use cases should especially address the use of metadata describing the functional and the data related properties. This includes metadata related to time, space, exchange/protocols, privacy, and security related aspects.
A functional description of the use case is to be included as a subsection called Functionalities and Activities. This section is mirroring our experience with documenting use cases as part of the Big Data Application Provider of NBDIF Reference Architecture. Hence, we assume the following draft form for a use case:

\begin{description}
\item[Title:] 		Title of the use case
\item[Contributor:] 	The list co contributors
\item[Description:] 	One to two sentences about major functionalities and activities with respect to the sample cross-functional diagram
	
	\begin{description}
	\item[Cross-Functional Diagram:]
		Inclusion of a cross functional Diagram, alternatively other diagrams could be 			chosen.
	\item[Functionality Activities:]
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Activity \#1 – description…
        \item ...
        \item Activity \#n – description…
    	\item Use Case Summaries
    \end{enumerate}
\end{description}
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/cross-functional-diagram.png}
    \caption{Cross-functional Diagram}
    \label{fig:cross-functional-diagram}
\end{figure}


Here we will list use case summaries and if available point to specific publications on the NBDIF Web page that include more details. The expectation of this section is to
 
\begin{itemize}
\item	Provide an overview of use cases that motivate this document
\item	It will summarize requirements that we obtain from these use cases that influence how we proceed.
\end{itemize}

As a result, we identify how they fit into the workflow of data analytics. This includes the description of a subset of functionality that is used in general by data analytics.  In particular, it described the relationship between input and output of data analytics components and interfaces. 

The use case summaries are expected to be available through the BigDataWG Web page at 


This includes the following examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	\href{https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0701_v1_2020102001.docx}{M0701} – Use case template
\item	\href{https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0702_v1_2020102002.pdf}{M0702} - Numeric weather prediction

\subsection{AS-FAIR-DO: Analytics Service FAIR Principle}

To project easy reusability, we strive towards the implementation of the AS-FAIR-DO principle for analytics services. The FAIR principle is typically applied to data and as such we can apply it the metadata associated with analytics services. The FAIR principal addresses who to be findable, be accessible, be interoperable, and be reusable. In Figure \ref{fig:as-fair-do} we explicitly augmented the general FAIR principle with terminology so it can apply to analytics services. The augmentations are colored in red.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Analytics Service Catalogue}

\paragraph{Motivation.} Cloud providers offered a considerable set of analytics services to their customers. There are many analytics services available. A user needs to be able to quickly obtain an overview of such available services. This helps identifying further actions in order to evaluate them and identify if further investigation is justified. The catalouge contains enough details to locate the service and evaluate if it is useful. However, it may not provide technical details which are captured by a service registry instead.

\paragraph{Access Requirements.} The catalogue may be public or may be restricted while authorized entities may access it. As analytics services may evolve over time, time dependent versioned descriptions of the services must be able to be included. An organizational entity may manage their own catalogues. It is desirable to have the catalogues be uniform, so that they can be combined into a larger catalogue combining entries of multiple organizations. 


\paragrap{Federation.} The offerings are typically limited to a particular vendor. Users can benefit from a federates service catalogue  to search and explore for needed services by the user. In contrast to a registry a catalogue may not include all technical details but could in contrast include services that lack such details and thus can be the basis of an exploratory process.  A Federated analytics service repository is planned to be hosted on GitHub (LINK TBD)
The catalogue contains the following attributes, many of which are also used in an analytics service registry.

The catalogue is organized as a list of entries, where each entry contains a number of attributes. These attributes may be required or optional. We list in Table \ref{tab:cat}. 


\begin{table}[htb]

\end{tabular}

\end{table}


\subsubsubsection{Analytics Service Registry}

\paragraph{Motivation.} 
The goal of a federated analytics service registry is to establish federated registries to locate and consume analytics services with persistent identifiers across organizations. 

A service registry can serve as a public, private, or federated registry. The first two properties define if the registry is public or private. In case of a private registry proper security measures need to be taken into account to govern access. Our framework does not make any recommendations about the security framework chosen and it is up to the implementer to specify it. In case of a federated registry, more than one registry can be joined, to provide the user the impression of a single registry.

Within the analytics services we distinguish two classes. The first class are instantiated (running) services that are offered by a service provider and allow direct reuse. The second class are library providers that distribute analytics activity not as an instantiated service, but as a source code library which can be deployed as a service. 


A user wants to find an analytics service and needs to identify a service based on its description and features. Users want The user want to find services quickly and therefor expects that keywords and taxonomies as well as descriptions help to identify the appropriate analytics service from the registry.

The registry contains enough details to not only locate the service, but also how to use it.

\paragraph{Access Requirements.} Public Analytics Service Registry. Public analytics services are intended to allow users to find publicly hosted services. The information provided includes the provider and makes it easy to locate such a service.

\begin{description}

\item[Private Analytics Service Registry.] The analytics service is stored in a private registry is only available to authenticated and authorized users. This allows to build virtual organizations that advertise specialized services to its user community. In contrast to a public analytics registry access is restricted. In addition, different group privileges may restrict the visible analytics service to the user.

\item[Federated Analytics Service Registry.] A user wants to decide which service to use. An analytics service broker/provider therefore offers a federated analytics service in which multiple services from multiple providers are included. The user instead of visiting each providers registry can visit the registry of the analytics broker to find suitable services. It is expected that federated registries allow to  locate and consume analytics services with persistent identifiers across organizations.  The federated analytics service registry may be enhanced with information that the original service provider may not have available. This could include for example cost comparisons or ratings from its user community.

\item[Enhanced Analytics Service Registry.] Both public and private registries my need to be enhanced by providing detailed information so the user has a better understanding of the offering and allows comparison to similar registry entries. This may include benchmark information, service level agreements and cost including carbon cost, as well as limitations such as storage access and availability for big data.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Registry Namespace.} To allow a uniform integration of entries into a unified namespace URLs are used to distinguish the services. This includes two different entities. First, an entity that defines the code base of a service. Such code base could be for example hosted on publicly accessible code repositories. Second, it could include instantiated analytics service endpoints that define a running instance of an analytics services.


The attributes are listed in Table \ref{tab:reg}. Some attributes may be optional and may be dependent on if they are deployed services, or contain a library that may be deployed.

TODO: Describe service provider, library provider infrastructure provider. Do a separate section for that ….

\subsubsection{Benefits of a federated analytics service registry}

A service registry can publicize and improve end user access to data from different sources, by overcoming some of the challenges inherent in describing and surfacing document content and format. Publication, and discovery of information resources are enriched with metadata enabling the findability and reusability of a service supporting the FAIR principle. While describing the interfaces and allow for the instantiation or the reuse of already instantiated services we address the accessibility and interoperability. With respect to analytics as a service, end users should be able to find various analytic services and similar services without having to individually search multiple ‘locations’ or databases, each built to operate on its own, unique storage and retrieval constructs. Through these descriptions automated service integration can be provisioned while targeting not only the functionality involved, but also allowing service level considerations to be addressed. Furthermore, such analytics services could provide significant security implications such as the protection of a database while only exposing a subsect of approved analytics functions that are executed on the data sets. This includes partial and controlled sharing of data mashup that can be made available to the community and registered to make reuse easier without everyone having to replicate the service.




\subsubsection{Analytics Service Pipelines}

\paragraph{Motivation.} In many cases a big data analysis is split up in multiple subtasks. These subtasks may be reusable in other analytics pipelines. Hence it is desirable to be able to specify and use them in a coordinated fashion allowing reuse of the logic represented by the analysis. Users must have a clear understanding on what the analysis is doing and how it can be invoked and integrated. 

\paragraph{Access Requirements.} The analysis must include a clear and easy to understand specification that encourages reuse and provides sufficient details about its functionality, data dependency and performance. Analytics services may have authentication, autorotation and access controls build in that enable access buy users controlled by the service providers.
