Over the last several years, the computation landscape for conducting
data analytics has completely changed. While in the past, a lot of the
activities have been undertaken in isolation by companies, and
research institutions, today's infrastructure constitutes a wealth of
services offered by a variety of providers that offer opportunities
for reuse, and interactions while leveraging service collaboration,
and service cooperation.

This document focuses on expanding analytics services to develop a
framework for reusable hybrid multi-service data analytics. It
includes (a) a short technology review that explicitly targets the
intersection of hybrid multi-provider analytics services, (b) a small
motivation based on use cases we looked at, (c) enhancing the concepts
of services to showcase how hybrid, as well as multi-provider services
can be integrated and reused via the proposed framework, (d) address
analytics service composition, and (e) integrate container
technologies to achieve state-of-the-art analytics service deployment
capabilities.
