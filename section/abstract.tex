Over the last several years, the computation landscape for conducting
data analytics has completely changed. While in the past a lot of the
activities have been undertaken in isolation by companies and research
institutions, today's infrastructure constitutes a wealth of services
offered by a variety of providers that offer opportunities for reuse,
interactions whil leveraging service colaboration, and service
cooperation.

In this document, we focus on expanding analytics services to
developing a framework for reusable hybrid multi-service data
analytics. It includes (a) a short technology review that explicitly
targets the intersection of hybrid multi-provider analytics services
(b) a small motivation based on usecases with looked at (c) enhancing
the concepts of services to showcase how hybrid, as well as
multi-provider services, can be integrated and reused via the proposed
framework, (d) address analytics service composition, and (e)
integrate container technologies to achieve state-of-the-art analytics
service deployment capabilities.
