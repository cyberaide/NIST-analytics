\subsection{Package Analytic Algorithms as Service Payloads}
\label{sec:package}

It is important to package analytic algorithms with well-defined
input and output parameters as service payloads that can be reusable,
deployable, and operational across multi-cores, CPUs, and GPU
computing platforms.
In additio, it is possible to package anayltics services on several 
different levels. This includes containers, binary packages, source
code, as well as the distribution of analytics fucntions thet can be
send between services.
