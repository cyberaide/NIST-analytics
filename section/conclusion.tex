\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have outlined our thoughts on building an analytics services framework. We have integrated aspects to make these services hybrid services across various compute providers including HPC, clouds, and microservices.

In addition to this exploratory thought, a component-based prototype implementation leveraging cloudmesh has been used to verify the feasibility of the approach. It has then been tested theoretically on some applications, while it also has been practically explored in the area of natural language processing and earthquake forecasting.

Furthermore, the framework has been used intensely as part of the MLCommons Science Working group where it was used for additional application.
