\label{sec:data}

As data is to be integrated and analyzed as well as produced the
framework must include a sufficintly broad ability to access data from
a wide variety of sources and utilize many different services.  This
includes files, object stors, and databases.  To address the access of
file based data we have integrated into cloudmesh components to deal
with transfers and copies from remote resources, as well as developed
a component that deals with many file transfers through globus. The
later overcomes restrictions due to file numbers and improves transfer
speed, access speed.
