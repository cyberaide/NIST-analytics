Over the last several years, the computation landscape for conducting 
data analytics has completely changed. While in the past,
a lot of the activities have been undertaken in isolation by companies,
and research institutions, today's infrastructure constitutes a wealth
of analytics services offered by a variety of providers that offer opportunities
for reuse, interactions while leveraging service collaboration, and service cooperation.

In this talk, we project our vision to develop an analytics services framework to integrate reusable hybrid multi-services across different cloud infrastructure and service providers as well 
as on-premise infrastructure and services. It includes (a) analytics services that explicitly target the intersection of hybrid multi-provider analytics services, (b) the integration of sensor networks into the service data, (c) the integration of advanced modeling services as part of analytical tasks such as earthquake prediction, and (d) the coordination of these services. We showcase how our vision can integrate leveraging service composition with cooperation and competition analytics services. We demonstrate the activities while utilizing benchmark analytics services as used by the  MLCommons science benchmark working group.
