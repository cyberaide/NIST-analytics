\section{Use Cases for Analytics Services}
\label{sec:usecases}

Our work is motivated by a number of use cases. The use cases were
contributed by community members who are experts in their fields.


The use cases include security; numerical weather prediction; 
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) optimization; and earthquake prediction. 


Each use case includes a high-level explanation about the problem they address and 
explicitly comments on requirements needed for an analytics service targeting the individual use case.
We summarize the major requirements for all use cases in Table~\ref{tab:summary-as-requirements}
