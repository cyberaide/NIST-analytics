1. Russell presents his thought on 

    * Interest federated registry
    * Gov seems interested that are closely related to that area
    * Russel collects some back ground that could provide some value
    
    * network models and participants
      * think about the audience 
        roles of the audience: not dev, not middle management, 
        but people with decision making
        
        distinguish centralized, federated, decentralized
            russel says today people look at centralized models
            
    * write down why users benefit from contributing
    
    
    
some thoughts on some things to include

\section{Network Models}

Perhaps additional clarification on the differences between a centralized, a federated, and distributed networks. Something along the lines of  - 

In a centralized model, spokes connect to hubs. User’s identity management consists of usernames and passwords [or mfa, or sso] - for each [disconnected] hub and spoke system. In centralized, Systems control the user’s data. 

In a federated model, spokes connect to hubs, and hubs in the federation are connected to other hubs. A single party controls {\em onboarding} and authentication. But {\em federated identity only addresses authentication} [baya]. Is Federated identity still challenging? Login with Social enables semi-portable / small scale ID but these are not sufficient for high security onboarding needs. Openid, oauth, and saml can work here. Systems control the user’s data.

\item[Federation:] communities with {\em joint interests around a specific set of information}. DOJ for example. Information ‘containers’ are cataloged and visible, while the assets themselves are maintained by members. However, a federated information reference model does more than provide access to data from different systems. It allows an existing system to run while the system undergoes transition. Keys from cross agency [IAC].

In a decentralized model, there are no hubs; spokes connect to spokes. Users control their own data, and identity can be fully portable. Digital ledgers and crypto for verifying credentials can work here. Example decentralized ID system with four components:

Trusted credential authority: the department of motor vehicles for example, who ISSUE a credential such as a drivers license to a user, and can attest to a users CLAIM of some aspect of their identity such as ‘my date of birth is’ 10/10/2010.

\item[User:] in this model users must have digital wallets, to carry private keys.

\item[Verifier:] an entity such as a bank, or employer, which desires to verify a user’s identity.

\item[Metadata registry:] stores identification public keys. The registry provides a service which assures the verifier that an issuer has attested to / confirmed the provenance or validity of a user’s claim or credential.

Also possibly include a Value analysis of the federated model [[alternative] over current case or centralized model] as seen from a multiple stakeholder perspective. Improved interop potential.

\begin{description}

                \item[User value:] knowledge sharing, and time saving.

                \item[Owner operational value:] reuse of existing artefacts, and increase in productivity.

                \item[Owner/registration authority financial value:] cost savings.

                \item[Social value:] coordination of governmental artefact sharing and reduction in taxpayer dollars.

\section{Network Participation}


2a. Creation of federated registry and repository} may begin with populating the repository with some initial elements. In our case, analytic services, etc.

Perhaps presenting some arguments for why [early member's] artefact producers would benefit from sharing their artefacts with the federation. One reason may be a scenario where the producer’s artefact can be verified by a third party. Some concept of a stamp of approval if you will. Another scenario might be that the producer’s artefact could be extended: Either where the artefact core functionality is advanced / enhanced; or where the artefact is applied to a different use case. A third rationale is of course that the producer’s artefact serves the public interest, or benefits a community of users, and the artefact producer receives philanthropic benefit.

2b. I also feel like we should improve on an existing diagram by separating the primary user’s activity flow paths.
