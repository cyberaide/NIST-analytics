\section{Use Cases for Analytics Services}
\label{sec:usecases}


\subsection{Use Case Development Process}

To specify use cases for our analytics framework, we encourage contributors to contact us and provide us with their high-level descriptions of their use cases. The use cases should be focusing on highlighting one or multiple aspects of the features related to analytics frameworks. While inspecting the various features we intend to collect and analyze them in various contexts that are relevant for analytics users. The lessons learned from this analysis are to be integrated into this document in order to formulate a comprehensive vendor neutral analytics framework.
Use cases can be formulated in various format but should include diagrams that make them easy to comprehend as well as allowing the reader to extract the specific analytical aspects. Such diagrams can include functional cross diagrams, process diagrams and others.
Use cases should especially address the use of metadata describing the functional and the data related properties. This includes metadata related to time, space, exchange/protocols, privacy, and security related aspects.
A functional description of the use case is to be included as a subsection called Functionalities and Activities. This section is mirroring our experience with documenting use cases as part of the Big Data Application Provider of NBDIF Reference Architecture. Hence, we assume the following draft form for a use case:

\begin{description}
\item[Title:] 		Title of the use case
\item[Contributor:] 	The list co contributors
\item[Description:] 	One to two sentences about major functionalities and activities with respect to the sample cross-functional diagram
	
	\begin{description}
	\item[Cross-Functional Diagram:]
		Inclusion of a cross functional Diagram, alternatively other diagrams could be 			chosen.
	\item[Functionality Activities:]
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Activity \#1 -- description ...
        \item ...
        \item Activity \#n -- description ...
    	\item Use Case Summaries
    \end{enumerate}
\end{description}
\end{description}

Next, we will list use case summaries and if available point to specific publications on the NBDIF Web page that include more details. The expectation of this section is to
 
\begin{itemize}
\item	Provide an overview of use cases that motivate this document
\item	It will summarize requirements that we obtain from these use cases that influence how we proceed.
\end{itemize}

As a result, we identify how they fit into the workflow of data analytics. This includes the description of a subset of functionality that is used in general by data analytics.  In particular, it described the relationship between input and output of data analytics components and interfaces.  The use case summaries are expected to be available through the BigDataWG Web page and includes currently the following examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	\href{https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0701_v1_2020102001.docx}{M0701} -- Use case template \cite{nist-usecase-template}
\item	\href{https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0702_v1_2020102002.pdf}{M0702} -- Numeric weather prediction \cite{nist-wrf}
\item	\href{https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0703_v1_2020102003.pdf}{M0703} -- HVAC Heat ventilation and air conditioning \cite{nist-hvac}
\end{enumerate}
