\subsection{AS-FAIR-DO: Analytics Service FAIR Principle}

To project easy reusability, we strive towards the implementation of
the AS-FAIR-DO principle for analytics services. The FAIR principle is
typically applied to data and as such we can apply it the metadata
associated with analytics services. The FAIR principal addresses who
to be findable, be accessible, be interoperable, and be reusable. In
Figure \ref{fig:as-fair-do} we explicitly augmented the general FAIR
principle with terminology so it can apply to analytics services. The
augmentations are colored in red.

\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}p{15cm}}

\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Findable:} \\
F1 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier \\ 
F2 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services} data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1) \\
F3 &  \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data related to the analytics services it describes \\ 
F4 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} are registered or indexed in a searchable resource \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Accessible:} \\
A.1 &  \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol \\
    A1.1 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services} the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable \\
    A1.2 & the \textcolor{red}{analytics services} protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary \\ 
A.2 & \textcolor{red}{metadata} are accessible, even when the data are no longer available \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Interoperable:}\\
I1. & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. \\
I2. &  \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles \\
I3. &  \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} include qualified references to other metadata \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Reusable:} \\
R1. & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes \\
R1.1 & (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license \\
R1.2 & (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance \\
R1.3 & (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Deployable:}\\
D.1 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} ... \\
\multicolumn{2}{l}{To be Operational:} \\ 
O.1 & \textcolor{red}{analytics services metadata} ... \\
