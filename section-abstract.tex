Over the last several years, the computation landscape for conducting
data analytics has completely changed. While in the past a lot of
the activities have been undertaken in isolation by companies and
research institutions, today's infrastructure constitutes a wealth of
services offered by a variety of providers that offer
opportunities for reuse and interactions.

In this document, we document how to expand analytics services to
focus on developing a framework for reusable hybrid multi-service data
analytics. It includes (a) a short technology review that explicitly
targets the intersection of hybrid multi-provider analytics services
(b) enhancing the concepts of services to showcase how hybrid, as well
as multi-provider services, can be integrated and reused via the
proposed framework, (d) address analytics service composition, and (c)
integrate container technologies to achieve state-of-the-art analytics
service deployment capabilities.
