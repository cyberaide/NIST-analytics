## Real-time Analytics

As the data volume increases exponentially from remote end users over time ( the number of connected IoT devices set to reach 24.1 billion by 2030), and enhancement in semiconductors, real-time data analytics is transiting from a single-domain analytics/network to a multi-domain real time, geo-distributed network/edges enterprises i.e. IoTs, where different enterprise member networks contribute various resources, e.g., computation, algorithms, in edge devises, storage and networking resources, to collaboratively collect, share and analyze small, and extremely large amounts of data. Such a network calls for a resource orchestration framework that emphasizes the performance predictability of data analytics jobs, the high utilization of resources, and the autonomy and privacy of members networks.

The emerging chip-sets in IoT's will generate Real-time analytics turns data into insights immediately after it is collected. These kinds of insights are used when time is of the essence (i.e. remote patient monitoring). Otherwise known as operational intelligence, real-time analytics can predict when is patient health turns to critical cases, warning care givers team before it happens. 
To better understand how real-time analytics works, letâ€™s compare it to traditional analytics, or batch processing. With the traditional approach, limited sets of historical data are stored and indexed. When business users need insights, they query the system. Batch processing is typically used for routine tasks like generating monthly patient care diagnoses or running demographic patient population queries.
While batch reporting is appropriate for tasks that are not time sensitive, others require immediate insights, such as patient safety monitoring or fraud detection and privacy. This is where real-time analytics comes in.
IoT devices and smart sensors are used in different life sectors, including industry, business, surveillance, healthcare, transportation, communication, and many others. These IoT devices and sensors produce tons of data that might be valued and beneficial for healthcare organizations if it becomes subject to analysis, which brings big data real-time analytics into the picture. Recently, the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) outbreak is seriously threatening human health, life, production, social interactions, and international relations. In this situation, the IoT and big data technologies have played an essential role in fighting against the pandemic. The applications might include the rapid collection of big data, visualization of pandemic information, breakdown of the epidemic risk, tracking of confirmed cases, tracking of prevention levels, and adequate assessment of COVID-19 prevention and control.
Demonstrate a health monitoring framework takes advantage of Big data analytics and IoT, descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis applying big data analytics using a novel disease real data set, focusing on different pandemic symptoms. Key contribution is integrating Big Data Analytics and IoT to analyze and predict a novel disease. The neural network-based. Using neural networks and also compare the results with other machine learning algorithms. The results reveal that the neural network performs comparatively better with an accuracy rate of 99%.
