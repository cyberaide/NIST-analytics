a public working group, we had one member of the group asking to keep

group by contacting Wo Chang at \verb|wchang@nist.gov|.

{\em Please note that we stopped using Word for the document
  management contributors consistently used different templates and
  formatting rules resulting in unsustainable multi hourlong cleanups
  every week instead of being able to focus on content. For this
  reason, we will not switch back to Word. However, a section could be
  written in markdown, which can easily be integrated into the
  document. Formatting should be kept at a minimum.}
